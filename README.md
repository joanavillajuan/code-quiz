# Code Quiz

This weeks challenge, we are to create a web application from scratch building a code Quiz with multiple-choice questions.The challenge is to use Javascript utalising DOM manipulation to create an interacting web application. The web application itself contains questions with multiple choice questions, when answered incorrectly the timer will decrease the duration of time by 10 seconds and will also lose points. When the quiz ends, it will ask for the users initials to store their scores.

## User Story

As a developer, I can have better chances getting employed by utalising Web APIs and creating an interactive web application.
